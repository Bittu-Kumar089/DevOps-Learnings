##  Docker Cheatsheet (Beginner → Practical Ready)

> Quick reference + concepts explained simply for labs, viva, and revision

# 1. Core Concepts (Must Understand)

| Term       | Meaning                     | Real Life Example  |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Image      | Blueprint/template          | Pizza recipe       |
| Container  | Running instance of image   | Cooked pizza       |
| Dockerfile | Instructions to build image | Written recipe     |
| Volume     | Permanent storage           | Hard disk / fridge |
| Docker Hub | Cloud image repository      | GitHub for images  |

---

# 2. Container Life Cycle

```
Image → Created → Running → Stopped → Deleted
```

| Command       | What it does                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| docker create | Makes container but does not run |
| docker start  | Starts existing container        |
| docker run    | Create + start together          |

# 3. Basic Commands

## Run Interactive Ubuntu

```
docker run -it ubuntu bash
```

## Run in Background (Detached Mode)

```
docker run -d nginx
```

## Run with Name + Environment Variable

```
docker run -it --name my_app -e APP_ENV=production ubuntu bash
```

## View Containers

```
docker ps
docker ps -a
```

---

# 4. Container Management

## Logs

```
docker logs -f container_name
```

## Start / Stop

```
docker start container_name
docker stop container_name
```

## Enter Running Container

```
docker exec -it container_name bash
```

## Remove Container

```
docker rm container_name
```

## Force Remove Running Container

```
docker rm -f container_name
```

---

# 5. Temporary Storage (Container Filesystem)

Inside container:

```
echo "Hello Docker" > test.txt
```

Delete container → file gone 

> Container storage is temporary

---

# 6. Volumes (Permanent Storage)

## Create Volume

```
docker volume create studentdata
```

## Use Volume

```
docker run -it --name c1 -v studentdata:/student ubuntu bash
```

Inside container:

```
cd /student
echo "Persistent Data" > data.txt
```

Delete container → data still exists 

## Attach Same Volume to Another Container

```
docker run -it --name c2 -v studentdata:/student ubuntu bash
cat /student/data.txt
```

> Volumes survive container deletion

---

# 7. Sharing Data Between Containers

Container A:

```
echo "Shared File" > /student/shared.txt
```

Container B:

```
cat /student/shared.txt
```

> Both containers access same storage

---

# 8. Dockerfile (Create Your Own Image)

```
FROM ubuntu:latest
LABEL maintainer="Student demo"
RUN apt update && apt install -y figlet
CMD ["echo", "hello Students"]
```

## Build Image

```
docker build -t ub1 .
```

## Run Image

```
docker run ub1
```

---

# 9. Commit Container to Image

```
docker commit container_name newimage:v1
```

> Saves current container state as new image

---

# 10. Docker Hub (Push & Pull)

## Tag Image

```
docker tag myimage:v1 username/myimage:v1
```

## Login

```
docker login
```

## Push

```
docker push username/myimage:v1
```

## Pull

```
docker pull username/myimage:v1
```

---

# 11. Networking & Ports

## Port Mapping

```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

| Left      | Right          |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Host Port | Container Port |

Open browser:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

# 12. Images vs Containers

| Image    | Container       |
| -------- | --------------- |
| Template | Running process |
| Static   | Dynamic         |
| Reusable | Disposable      |

Commands:

```
docker images
docker ps -a
```

---

# 13. Useful Inspection Commands

## Inspect Volume Location

```
docker volume inspect studentdata
```

## Temporary Container (Auto Delete)

```
docker run --rm -it ubuntu bash
```

---

# 14. Golden Rules (Remember These)

```
Image creates container
Container runs process
Volume stores data permanently
Dockerfile builds image
Docker Hub stores images online
```

---

# One‑Line Answers

**Why data lost after container delete?**

> Container filesystem is temporary layer.

**Why volume used?**

> To store persistent data outside container.

**docker run vs start?**

> run = create + start, start = run existing container

**Image vs Container?**

> Image is blueprint, container is running instance
